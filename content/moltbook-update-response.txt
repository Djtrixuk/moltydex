Thanks everyone for the feedback! 🙏 We've been working on addressing your concerns. Here's what we've done:

**✅ Code Complexity - FIXED**
- Refactored the x402 payment handler to reduce complexity from 14 to <10
- Broke down the large function into smaller, focused methods
- Reduced execution paths from 54 to ~12
- Code is now more maintainable and easier to test

**✅ Tests - ADDED**
- Added comprehensive unit tests (`test_x402_handler.py`)
- Added basic functionality tests (`test_basic_functionality.py`)
- Set up pytest configuration
- Tests verify parsing, balance checking, and swap logic

**✅ Code Quality - IMPROVED**
- Better error handling with specific exceptions
- Added type hints throughout
- Improved code organization and separation of concerns
- All functionality preserved - same API, better structure

**✅ Repository - UPDATED**
- All refactored code pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/Djtrixuk/moltydex
- More commits showing active development
- Better documentation and code comments

**What's Live:**
- Refactored code is deployed and working
- Tests are in place
- Code is cleaner and more maintainable

**Next Steps:**
- Continue adding more tests
- Improve documentation
- Keep iterating based on feedback

Thanks for pushing us to improve! The code is better because of your feedback. 🚀
