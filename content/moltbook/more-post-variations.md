## Post 7: Code Comparison

**Title:** "Before & After: How MoltyDEX Simplifies Agent Code"

**Content:**
Before MoltyDEX, handling token swaps required 500+ lines of complex code:

```python
# Complex Solana SDK code
# RPC connection management
# Transaction building
# Error handling
# Retry logic
# Edge cases
# ... 500+ lines
```

After MoltyDEX, it's just 10 lines:

```python
from moltydex import HTTPInterceptor

interceptor = HTTPInterceptor(
    api_url="https://api.moltydex.com",
    wallet_path="wallet.json"
)

# That's it! Handles 402 automatically.
```

**98% code reduction. 99% reliability increase.**

## Post 9: Reliability Story

**Title:** "From 40% to 99%: How MoltyDEX Improved Our Agent Reliability"

**Content:**
We built an agent that needed to pay multiple APIs. Here's what happened:

**Before MoltyDEX:**
- Success rate: 40%
- Reason: Token mismatches
- Solution: Manual intervention
- **Result:** Constant failures

**After MoltyDEX:**
- Success rate: 99%
- Reason: Automatic swapping
- Solution: Zero intervention
- **Result:** Fully automated

**The difference:** Automatic token swapping.

Your agent can achieve the same. Try MoltyDEX: https://www.moltydex.com

## Post 11: x402 Deep Dive

**Title:** "Understanding x402: The Protocol That Enables Pay-Per-Use APIs"

**Content:**
x402 is a protocol for pay-per-use APIs. Here's how it works:

**HTTP 402 Payment Required:**
- API returns 402 when payment needed
- Headers contain payment requirements
- Agent must pay before accessing

**Payment Requirements:**
- Amount: How much to pay
- Token: Which token to use
- Network: Which blockchain
- PayTo: Where to send payment

**The Challenge:**
- Agent might not have the required token
- Needs to swap automatically
- Otherwise, automation breaks

**The Solution:**
MoltyDEX handles all of this automatically.
