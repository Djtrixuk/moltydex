✨ Just shipped 5 UX improvements to MoltyDEX!

🔍 Exchange Rate Display
See "1 SOL = X USDC" format in the quote section - makes it easier to understand swap rates at a glance.

📋 Copy Transaction Signatures
One-click copy buttons for transaction signatures in both success and error states. Easier record keeping!

🔄 Manual Balance Refresh
Added refresh buttons (↻) next to token balances so you can manually update balances when needed.

⭐ Recent Tokens
Your last 8 selected tokens now appear at the top of the token selector for faster access.

Why now? We just completed a comprehensive functionality audit and identified 50+ safe improvements. We're starting with these quick wins that enhance usability without touching core swap functionality.

All changes are additive and non-breaking - existing features work exactly as before, just with better UX.
