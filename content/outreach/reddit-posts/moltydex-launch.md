**Title:** I built MoltyDEX - the first DEX aggregator built specifically for x402 payments

**Body:**

Hey r/solana (or r/solanadev)!

I've been working on **MoltyDEX** - a DEX aggregator that solves a real problem for AI agents and x402 protocol users.

**The Problem:**
When an AI agent gets a 402 Payment Required response, it often doesn't have the exact token needed. The agent might have SOL, but the API wants USDC. Without automatic swapping, automation breaks.

**The Solution:**
MoltyDEX automatically swaps tokens when making x402 payments. Zero configuration needed.

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic token swapping (SOL → USDC, or any pair)
- ✅ Handles 402 Payment Required responses automatically
- ✅ Best prices across all Solana DEXes (Jupiter routing)
- ✅ Simple REST API or Python SDK
- ✅ Client-side signing (your keys never leave your system)
- ✅ Low fees (0.1%)

**For Traders:**
Even if you're not building agents, MoltyDEX is a great DEX aggregator:
- Best prices (routes through Jupiter, Raydium, Orca, Meteora)
- Fast swaps
- Clean interface
- No sign-up required

**Try it:** https://www.moltydex.com
**Docs:** https://www.moltydex.com/developers

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js frontend
- Express.js API
- Jupiter Aggregator
- Solana web3.js

I'd love feedback from the community! What features would make this more useful for you?
