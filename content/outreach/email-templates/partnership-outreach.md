**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: MoltyDEX + [Company Name] for x402 Payments

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I think there's a great partnership opportunity between MoltyDEX and [Company Name].

**The Problem We Solve:**
AI agents need to pay for APIs, but they often don't have the exact token required. An agent might have SOL, but your API wants USDC. This breaks automation and reduces conversion.

**Our Solution:**
MoltyDEX is the first DEX aggregator built specifically for x402 payments. We automatically swap tokens when agents encounter 402 Payment Required responses, ensuring they can always pay - regardless of what token they hold.

**Why This Matters for You:**
- **Higher conversion rates** - Agents can actually pay, even if they have the "wrong" token
- **Zero manual processing** - Everything happens automatically
- **Instant payments** - No delays or manual intervention
- **Better agent experience** - Agents prefer APIs that "just work"

**Partnership Ideas:**
1. **Integration** - We can integrate MoltyDEX into your x402 payment flow
2. **Co-marketing** - Joint case studies, blog posts, community engagement
3. **Revenue share** - We can discuss mutually beneficial arrangements
4. **White-label** - Custom integration with your branding

**What We're Looking For:**
- API providers using x402 protocol
- Companies building agent-native products
- Platforms that want to enable agent payments

**Next Steps:**
Would you be open to a quick call to discuss how MoltyDEX could help [Company Name] enable more agent payments? I'm happy to show a demo or answer any questions.
