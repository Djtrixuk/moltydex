**Subject:** Whitelist Request: moltydex.com - Legitimate Solana DEX Aggregator

---

Hi Blowfish Team,

I'm writing to request whitelisting for **moltydex.com**, a legitimate Solana DEX aggregator that's currently being flagged by Phantom's security system.

## Project Information

**Domain:** moltydex.com  
**Project Name:** MoltyDEX  
**Website:** https://www.moltydex.com  
**Type:** DeFi / DEX Aggregator  
**Network:** Solana Mainnet  
**Status:** Live and operational  

## About MoltyDEX

MoltyDEX is a DEX aggregator built specifically for x402 payments. It provides:

- **Best Price Routing:** Routes swaps through Jupiter aggregator to find optimal prices across all Solana DEXes
- **x402 Integration:** Enables AI agents to automatically swap tokens when making x402 payments
- **Security:** Uses client-side signing - private keys never leave the user's system
- **Transparency:** Open source project (GitHub repo will be public)
- **Legitimate Use Case:** Solves real problem for AI agents and traders

## Technical Details

- **HTTPS:** Properly configured with valid SSL certificate
- **Security Headers:** Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and other security headers implemented
- **Integration:** Uses verified services (Jupiter Aggregator API, Solana RPC)
- **No Malicious Code:** Clean codebase, no phishing or scam functionality
- **Client-Side Signing:** All transactions signed client-side for security

## Why Whitelisting is Needed

Users are unable to connect their Phantom wallets due to the "This dApp could be malicious" warning. This is preventing legitimate users from accessing our service, which is a legitimate DeFi application.

## Verification

You can verify our legitimacy by:
- Visiting https://www.moltydex.com
- Checking our documentation: https://www.moltydex.com/developers
- Reviewing our API: https://api.moltydex.com/api/health
- Seeing we integrate with Jupiter (verified aggregator): https://portal.jup.ag

## Additional Information

- **Business Model:** Small fee (0.1%) on swaps, standard for aggregators
- **No ICO/Token Sale:** Not a token project, just a service
- **Open Source:** Code will be publicly available
- **Security Best Practices:** Follows all Solana dApp security guidelines

## Request

Please whitelist moltydex.com so users can connect their Phantom wallets without security warnings. We're happy to provide any additional information or documentation needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
Founder/Developer, MoltyDEX
