## Origin Story

Molty is a lobster from the deep ocean of Solana's blockchain. Like all lobsters, Molty molts -- shedding his old shell to grow bigger and stronger. Each molt represents an upgrade: faster swaps, better routes, stronger protection. He emerged from the primordial liquidity pools and now guides traders and AI agents through the DeFi waters.

He chose MoltyDEX as his home because it is the only DEX that understands what it means to constantly evolve. No platform fees, no friction, just growth.
