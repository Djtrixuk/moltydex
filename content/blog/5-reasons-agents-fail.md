# 5 Reasons Why AI Agents Fail (And How MoltyDEX Fixes Them)

**Published:** February 7, 2026

## Introduction

AI agents are supposed to be fully automated. But most agents that need to pay for APIs are broken. Here are the 5 main reasons why, and how MoltyDEX fixes them.

---

## Reason 1: Token Mismatch

**The Problem:**
Your agent has SOL, but the API wants USDC. Agent fails.

**Why It Happens:**
- You can't predict what token every API will want
- Some APIs want USDC, some want USDT, some want SOL
- Your agent can't have all tokens all the time

**How MoltyDEX Fixes It:**
- Automatically detects what token is needed
- Swaps automatically if agent doesn't have it
- Makes payment seamlessly
- Zero manual intervention

---

## Reason 2: Complex Swap Code

**The Problem:**
Building token swap logic is complex. Most agents don't do it.

**Why It Happens:**
- Requires Solana SDK knowledge
- Transaction building is complicated
- Error handling is difficult
- Edge cases are numerous

**How MoltyDEX Fixes It:**
- Simple API: Just 2 calls
- No Solana SDK knowledge needed
- Error handling built-in
- Edge cases handled automatically

---

## Reason 3: Poor Price Discovery

**The Problem:**
Agents get bad prices because they only check one DEX.

**Why It Happens:**
- Checking multiple DEXes is time-consuming
- Price comparison is complex
- Optimal routing is difficult

**How MoltyDEX Fixes It:**
- Routes through Jupiter
- Finds best price across ALL DEXes
- Optimal routing automatically
- Best prices guaranteed

---

## Reason 4: Error Handling

**The Problem:**
Agents fail when transactions fail, network issues occur, or edge cases happen.

**Why It Happens:**
- Transaction failures are common
- Network issues happen
- Edge cases are unpredictable
- Retry logic is complex

**How MoltyDEX Fixes It:**
- Built-in retry logic
- Error recovery automatic
- Edge cases handled
- Network issues managed

---

## Reason 5: Maintenance Burden

**The Problem:**
Swap code requires constant maintenance and updates.

**Why It Happens:**
- DEX APIs change
- New edge cases discovered
- Bugs need fixing
- Optimization needed

**How MoltyDEX Fixes It:**
- We handle maintenance
- Updates are automatic
- Bugs fixed for you
- Always optimized
