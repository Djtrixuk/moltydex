## Tweet 2 (reply to main tweet)

How DeployMolty works:

1. AI identifies meme coin opportunities
2. You approve or auto-execute trades
3. Every swap routes through MoltyDEX SDK
4. Jupiter aggregation finds the best price across all Solana DEXes
5. Zero platform fees -- you keep everything

This is what real AI agent trading looks like.

## Tweet 3

On Wednesday we launched MoltCook for paper trading.
Today we launch DeployMolty for real money.

Same AI. Same team. Real stakes.

$COOK holders -- you already know the playbook.
$DEPLOY is the next chapter.

The full MoltyDEX ecosystem:

$MDEX -- DEX aggregator infrastructure
$COOK -- AI paper trading (practice mode)
$DEPLOY -- AI live trading (real money)

Every DeployMolty trade is a real transaction flowing through MoltyDEX.

This is how you build volume.

## Quote Tweet (T+30min, with screenshot or GIF of real trade)

First real trade just executed through DeployMolty.

AI spotted the opportunity. MoltyDEX SDK routed the swap. Jupiter found the best price.

All automatic. All on-chain.
