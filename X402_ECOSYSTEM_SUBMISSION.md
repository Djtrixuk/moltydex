### Description (Short - for directory listing)
**Solana DEX aggregator optimized for x402 payments. Enables AI agents to automatically swap tokens when making x402 payments, handling token conversion seamlessly. Best prices across all Solana DEXes, 0.1% fees, powered by Jupiter aggregator.**

### Full Description (Detailed)
MoltyDEX is the first DEX aggregator built specifically for x402 payments. It solves a critical problem: AI agents often need to pay for APIs using specific tokens (like USDC), but they may only have SOL or other tokens.

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Token Swapping**: Agents automatically swap any Solana token to the required payment token
- **x402 Auto-Pay Agent**: Fully automated payment handler that intercepts 402 responses, swaps tokens if needed, makes payments, and retries requests
- **Best Prices**: Routes through Jupiter aggregator to find best prices across all Solana DEXes
- **Low Fees**: 0.1% fee per swap
- **Agent-Friendly API**: Simple REST API designed for programmatic access
- **Secure**: Client-side signing - private keys never leave the agent's system

**Use Cases:**
1. **AI Agent Payments**: Agents can pay for x402 APIs automatically, even if they don't have the exact token required
2. **API Provider Integration**: API providers can accept any Solana token - agents swap automatically
3. **Multi-Token Workflows**: Agents can work with multiple APIs requiring different tokens seamlessly

**Technical Details:**
- Built on Solana blockchain
- Powered by Jupiter aggregator
- Supports all SPL tokens
- REST API with webhook support
- TypeScript SDK available
