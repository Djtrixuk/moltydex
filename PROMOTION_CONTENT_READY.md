Hey r/solana! 👋

I built **MoltyDEX** - a DEX aggregator that's specifically designed for x402 payments and AI agents, but works great for regular traders too.

**What makes it different:**
- **0% platform fees** - Completely free (you only pay Solana network fees)
- **Best prices** - Routes through Jupiter to find optimal prices across all DEXes
- **AI Agent focused** - Automatically handles token swapping for x402 payments
- **Wallet token discovery** - Shows all tokens in your wallet (like Jupiter)
- **Clean UI** - Simple, fast interface

**For AI Agents:**
When your agent gets a 402 Payment Required but has the wrong token, MoltyDEX automatically swaps it. Zero configuration needed.

**For Traders:**
Just want the cheapest swaps? We've got you covered with 0% fees and best price routing.
