## ✅ What Hackathons Care About

**They DON'T care:**
- ❌ Who created the video
- ❌ How polished it is (within reason)
- ❌ Professional editing

**They DO care:**
- ✅ Does it show the product working?
- ✅ Is the problem clear?
- ✅ Is the solution clear?
- ✅ Can judges understand it?

**Bottom Line:** As long as the video demonstrates your working product, it doesn't matter who created it!
