🚀 **Ecosystem Directory Submission - MoltyDEX**

Hi x402 community! I'd like to submit MoltyDEX for the ecosystem directory.

**Category:** Infrastructure & Tooling

**Website:** https://www.moltydex.com

**Description:**
Solana DEX aggregator optimized for x402 payments. Enables AI agents to automatically swap tokens when making x402 payments, handling token conversion seamlessly. Best prices across all Solana DEXes, 0.1% fees, powered by Jupiter aggregator.

**Key Features:**
✅ Automatic token swapping for x402 payments
✅ x402 auto-pay agent (fully automated payment handling)
✅ Best prices via Jupiter aggregator
✅ 0.1% fees
✅ Agent-friendly API

**Why it belongs:**
MoltyDEX solves a critical x402 problem - agents often don't have the exact token required for payments. We automatically swap any Solana token to the required payment token, enabling seamless x402 adoption.
