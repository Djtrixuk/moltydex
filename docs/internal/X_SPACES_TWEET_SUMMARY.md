## 🎯 Main Tweet (Recommended - TL;DR Style)

```
TL;DR from today's Spaces on MoltyDEX:

x402 market stats:
• $600M+ payment volume (Nov 2025)
• 15M+ AI agent transactions
• 10,000% monthly growth at peak
• Google Cloud, AWS, Cloudflare adopting

Problem: Token mismatch breaks automation. Agent has SOL, API wants USDC → payment fails.

Solution: MoltyDEX automatically swaps tokens when agents hit 402 Payment Required responses. Detects → swaps → pays → retries. Zero manual steps.

Currently 0% fees. We can charge but hit technical blocks, decided zero fees is better for early market share in an exploding market.

Live on Solana mainnet, production-ready.

Problem: Token mismatch breaks automation.

Agent has SOL, API wants USDC → payment fails → automation breaks. Manual swaps kill autonomous workflows.

MoltyDEX: Detects 402 responses → checks balances → swaps automatically → makes payment → retries request. Zero manual steps.
