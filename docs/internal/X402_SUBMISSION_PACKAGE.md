**Description (Short - for directory):**
Solana DEX aggregator optimized for x402 payments. Enables AI agents to automatically swap tokens when making x402 payments, handling token conversion seamlessly. Best prices across all Solana DEXes, 0.1% fees, powered by Jupiter aggregator.

**Description (Full - for review):**
MoltyDEX is the first DEX aggregator built specifically for x402 payments. It solves a critical problem in the x402 ecosystem: AI agents often need to pay for APIs using specific tokens (like USDC), but they may only have SOL or other tokens.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic Token Swapping: Agents automatically swap any Solana token to the required payment token
- x402 Auto-Pay Agent: Fully automated payment handler that intercepts 402 responses, swaps tokens if needed, makes payments, and retries requests - zero integration effort
- Best Prices: Routes through Jupiter aggregator to find best prices across all Solana DEXes
- Low Fees: 0.1% fee per swap
- Agent-Friendly API: Simple REST API with webhook support
- Secure: Client-side signing - private keys never leave the agent's system

**Use Cases:**
1. AI Agent Payments: Agents can pay for x402 APIs automatically, even if they don't have the exact token required
2. API Provider Integration: API providers can accept any Solana token - agents swap automatically
3. Multi-Token Workflows: Agents can work with multiple APIs requiring different tokens seamlessly

**Why MoltyDEX Belongs:**
MoltyDEX solves a critical x402 problem - token compatibility. Without MoltyDEX, agents must manually manage multiple token balances. With MoltyDEX, agents can pay with any token they have, enabling true automation and removing friction from x402 adoption.

**Technical Details:**
- Built on Solana blockchain
- Powered by Jupiter aggregator
- Supports all SPL tokens
- REST API with webhook support
- TypeScript SDK available
- Production-ready, live on Solana mainnet
