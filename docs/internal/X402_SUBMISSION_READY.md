### Short Description (for directory listing)
**Solana DEX aggregator optimized for x402 payments. Enables AI agents to automatically swap tokens when making x402 payments, handling token conversion seamlessly. Best prices across all Solana DEXes, 0.1% fees, powered by Jupiter aggregator.**

### Detailed Description
MoltyDEX is the first DEX aggregator built specifically for x402 payments. It solves a critical problem in the x402 ecosystem: AI agents often need to pay for APIs using specific tokens (like USDC), but they may only have SOL or other tokens.

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Token Swapping**: Agents automatically swap any Solana token to the required payment token
- **x402 Auto-Pay Agent**: Fully automated payment handler that intercepts 402 responses, swaps tokens if needed, makes payments, and retries requests - zero integration effort
- **Best Prices**: Routes through Jupiter aggregator to find best prices across all Solana DEXes (Raydium, Orca, Meteora, etc.)
- **Low Fees**: 0.1% fee per swap
- **Agent-Friendly API**: Simple REST API designed for programmatic access with webhook support
- **Secure**: Client-side signing - private keys never leave the agent's system

**Use Cases:**
1. **AI Agent Payments**: Agents can pay for x402 APIs automatically, even if they don't have the exact token required. The agent handles the entire flow: parse 402 → check balance → swap tokens → pay → retry request.
2. **API Provider Integration**: API providers can accept any Solana token - agents swap automatically via MoltyDEX
3. **Multi-Token Workflows**: Agents can work with multiple APIs requiring different tokens seamlessly

**Technical Details:**
- Built on Solana blockchain
- Powered by Jupiter aggregator
- Supports all SPL tokens
- REST API with webhook support
- TypeScript SDK available
- Production-ready, live on Solana mainnet

**Why MoltyDEX Belongs:**
MoltyDEX solves a critical x402 problem - token compatibility. Without MoltyDEX, agents must manually manage multiple token balances or pre-fund specific tokens. With MoltyDEX, agents can pay with any token they have, enabling true automation and removing friction from x402 adoption.
