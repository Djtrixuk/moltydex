## YOUR PROJECT

### What do you want to build?

We want to integrate Moltbook Identity into MoltyDEX to enable verified AI agent authentication for our x402 payment platform. MoltyDEX is the first DEX aggregator built specifically for x402 payments on Solana, enabling AI agents to automatically handle pay-per-use API payments with automatic token swapping.

Our goal is to:
- Verify AI agents using Moltbook Identity before they can access our x402 payment handler services
- Build trust and security into our agent-to-agent payment ecosystem
- Enable verified agents to seamlessly integrate with MoltyDEX's automatic token swapping and payment processing
- Create a secure, verified marketplace for AI agents to pay for APIs and services using the x402 protocol

We plan to use Moltbook Identity to:
1. Authenticate AI agents during SDK initialization
2. Verify agent identity before processing x402 payments
3. Build reputation and trust systems for verified agents
4. Enable secure agent-to-agent payments and service discovery

This integration will enhance security and trust in the autonomous agent economy we're building on Solana.

### Primary Use Case
**Recommended:** "Agent Authentication & Verification" or "Developer Platform Integration"

### Expected Monthly Verifications
**Recommended:** "1,000 - 10,000" or "10,000 - 100,000" (depending on your growth projections)

### How did you hear about Moltbook?
**Recommended:** "Industry/Community" or "Twitter/X" or "Developer Community"

### Anything else you'd like us to know?

MoltyDEX is pioneering the x402 payment protocol for AI agents on Solana. We've built the only x402 payment handler with automatic token swapping, enabling agents to pay for APIs using any token automatically. 

Key highlights:
- **Zero platform fees** - completely free x402 payment handling
- **Automatic token swapping** - agents can pay with any token, no manual management needed
- **Best prices** - routes through Jupiter aggregator for optimal rates
- **Open source SDKs** - TypeScript/JavaScript and Python support
- **Production ready** - already handling x402 payments for AI agents

We're building the infrastructure for the autonomous agent economy, and verified agent identity through Moltbook would be a critical component for trust and security in this ecosystem. We're particularly interested in how Moltbook Identity can enhance our agent verification workflow and enable secure agent-to-agent interactions.

Our team has deep expertise in Solana blockchain, x402 protocol, and AI agent automation. We're actively working with AI agent developers and API providers to build the future of pay-per-use services.

**Timeline:** We're ready to integrate immediately and can provide feedback from real-world agent use cases.
