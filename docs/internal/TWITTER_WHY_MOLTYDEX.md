# Twitter Tweet - Why We Built MoltyDEX

## Option 1: Problem-Focused (Recommended)

AI agents keep failing when they hit 402 Payment Required responses. They have SOL but APIs want USDC.

We built MoltyDEX so agents can automatically swap tokens and keep working. Zero manual intervention.

That's why $MDEX exists - to reward the builders fixing this.

## Option 2: Solution-Focused

Why MoltyDEX?

Because agents shouldn't break when APIs want different tokens. We auto-swap so your agent keeps running.

$MDEX rewards the early builders making this happen.
