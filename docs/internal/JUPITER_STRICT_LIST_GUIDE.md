# How to Get $MDEX Added to Jupiter's Strict List

## ⚠️ Important Update: Jupiter Verify (V3 System)

**The old PR-based system is deprecated.** Jupiter has replaced the GitHub pull request process with **Jupiter Verify**, a V3 token list system that uses organic discovery and community verification.

## New Process: Jupiter Verify

### How It Works

1. **Organic Score & Community Support**: Tokens are discovered and verified based on:
   - Good organic score
   - Community support (measured by "smart likes")

2. **Smart Likes System**: 
   - Users can "like" tokens on Jupiter's token pages
   - These "smart likes" help build community support
   - Tokens with sufficient organic support get verified automatically

### Steps to Get $MDEX Verified

1. **Get Your Token Page URL**:
   - Format: `https://jup.ag/tokens/{MINT_ADDRESS}`
   - For $MDEX: `https://jup.ag/tokens/HndwegC6q7UGn5MErjvdH6BeQzcWQtjZf1nJX6rhpump`

2. **Encourage Community to Like Your Token**:
   - Share the token page URL with your community
   - Ask supporters to visit the page and "like" the token
   - The more organic likes, the better your chances of verification

3. **Build Organic Activity**:
   - Ensure your token has real trading volume
   - Maintain active community engagement
   - Provide clear token information and branding

### Important Notes

- **No Manual Application**: You can no longer submit PRs to get on the strict list
- **Not an Endorsement**: Verification helps users find the correct token at the right mint address, but is not an endorsement of the project
- **Natural Discovery**: The system is designed to surface tokens that have genuine community support

## Old System (Deprecated - For Reference Only)

The old system required:
- Opening a PR on GitHub: `https://github.com/jup-ag/token-list`
- Providing attestations (Twitter tweet tagging @JupiterExchange)
- CoinGecko/CMC listing (optional but helpful)
- Matching on-chain metadata

**This system is no longer active** - all PRs will be closed.

## Recommended Actions for MoltyDEX

   - Include it in social media posts
   - Add it to your Moltbook posts

2. **Encourage Community Engagement**:
   - Ask early adopters and AI agent testers to like the token on Jupiter
   - Create a campaign around "liking $MDEX on Jupiter"
   - Make it easy for supporters to find and like your token

3. **Build Trading Volume**:
   - Ensure there's real liquidity and trading activity
   - The organic score likely factors in trading metrics

4. **Maintain Token Information**:
   - Ensure your token metadata is accurate and complete
   - Have a clear project description and branding

**Summary**: The process is now community-driven through Jupiter Verify. Focus on building organic support by encouraging your community to "like" $MDEX on Jupiter's token page, rather than submitting manual applications.
