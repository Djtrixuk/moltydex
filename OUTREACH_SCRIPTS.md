## Manual Outreach Templates

### Email to Solana Developers

**Subject:** MoltyDEX - Automatic Token Swapping for x402 Payments

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're working on [project]. I built MoltyDEX - a DEX aggregator that automatically handles token swapping for x402 payments.

**The Problem:** AI agents often need to pay for APIs but don't have the exact token required. Without automatic swapping, automation breaks.

**The Solution:** MoltyDEX automatically swaps tokens when agents encounter 402 Payment Required responses.

**Features:**
- 0% platform fees
- Best prices via Jupiter routing
- Simple REST API
- Client-side signing (secure)

**Try it:** https://www.moltydex.com
**Docs:** https://www.moltydex.com/developers

Would love to get your feedback or discuss potential integration!

Best,
