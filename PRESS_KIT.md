## The Problem It Solves

AI agents often need to pay for APIs but don't have the exact token required. An agent might have SOL, but the API wants USDC. Without automatic swapping, automation breaks.

MoltyDEX automatically handles token swapping when agents encounter 402 Payment Required responses, making x402 adoption seamless.
