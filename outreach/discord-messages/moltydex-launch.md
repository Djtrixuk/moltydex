Hey x402 community! 👋

Just launched **MoltyDEX** - solves the token swapping problem for x402 payments!

**The Problem:**
When agents get 402 responses, they often don't have the exact token needed. MoltyDEX automatically swaps tokens, making x402 adoption seamless.

**How It Works:**
1. Agent receives 402 Payment Required
2. MoltyDEX automatically swaps tokens (SOL → USDC, etc.)
3. Payment made seamlessly
4. Original request retried

**Features:**
- Automatic token detection and swapping
- Best prices (Jupiter routing)
- Simple API integration
- Client-side signing (secure)

**Try it:** https://www.moltydex.com
