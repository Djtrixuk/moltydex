## Description (Long - 500 chars)

MoltyDEX is a fast, cheap DEX aggregator for Solana that works for both humans and AI agents. For humans: simple web interface for instant token swaps with best prices. For agents: automatic x402 payment handling. Unlike other aggregators, MoltyDEX offers the lowest fees (0.1%) in the market.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic token swapping when agents encounter 402 Payment Required
- Routes through Jupiter aggregator for best prices across all Solana DEXes
- Client-side signing - your private keys never leave your system
- 0.1% fees, no subscriptions, no hidden costs
- Open source and production-ready

**The Problem:** AI agents need to pay for APIs, but often don't have the exact token required. An agent might have SOL, but the API wants USDC. Without automatic swapping, automation breaks.

**The Solution:** MoltyDEX handles everything automatically. Zero manual intervention needed.

Perfect for traders wanting the cheapest swaps, developers building AI agents, pay-per-use APIs, and automated workflows on Solana.
