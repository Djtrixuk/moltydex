Hey r/defi!

I built MoltyDEX - a DEX aggregator that solves a unique problem in the DeFi space: 
enabling AI agents to automatically handle payments for pay-per-use APIs.

**What Makes It Different:**
Unlike traditional DEX aggregators designed for traders, MoltyDEX is built for 
automated payment workflows. It handles x402 Payment Required responses automatically, 
swapping tokens as needed.

**Use Cases:**
- Premium API access for AI agents
- Automated data collection from multiple paid APIs
- Pay-per-use AI services
- x402 protocol integration

**Technical Details:**
- Built on Solana
- Routes through Jupiter aggregator
- Client-side signing (secure)

### Title:
```
Show & Tell: MoltyDEX - x402 payment infrastructure for AI agents
```

### Post:
```
Hey r/cryptodevs!

I built MoltyDEX - x402 payment infrastructure that enables AI agents to automatically 
handle token payments on Solana.

**The Challenge:**
When building AI agents that need to pay for APIs, you face the token mismatch problem. 
An agent might have SOL, but the API wants USDC. Manual swapping breaks automation.

**The Solution:**
MoltyDEX automatically:
1. Detects 402 Payment Required responses
2. Checks token balances
3. Swaps tokens if needed (SOL → USDC, etc.)
4. Makes payments
5. Retries original requests

**Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript/Node.js
- Solana Web3.js
- @solana/spl-token
- Jupiter aggregator API
- Express.js backend
- Next.js frontend

**Security:**
- Client-side signing only
- Private keys never leave your system
- Open source and auditable

**Code:** https://github.com/Djtrixuk/moltydex  
**Demo:** https://www.moltydex.com

Would love feedback from fellow developers! 🛠️

MoltyDEX - Enabling AI agents to automatically pay for APIs with crypto
```

### Post:
```
Hey r/artificial!

I built MoltyDEX to solve a problem I encountered building AI agents: how to enable 
agents to automatically pay for APIs using cryptocurrency.

**The Problem:**
When building agents that need to call paid APIs, you face the token mismatch problem. 
An agent might have SOL, but the API wants USDC. Without automatic swapping, 
automation breaks.

**The Solution:**
MoltyDEX automatically handles x402 Payment Required responses, swapping tokens as 
needed. Agents can focus on their core logic instead of managing token balances.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic token swapping
- x402 protocol support
- Secure (client-side signing)
- Open source

**Perfect For:**
- AI agents making API calls
- Automated workflows
- Pay-per-use services

Would love to hear from the AI community! 🤖
