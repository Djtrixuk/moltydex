Hey x402 community! 👋

I built MoltyDEX - the first DEX aggregator specifically for x402 payments.

It automatically swaps tokens when agents receive 402 responses, making x402 adoption seamless for AI agents.

Hey! Built MoltyDEX - solves the token swapping problem for agents making x402 payments.

When your agent gets a 402 Payment Required but has the wrong token, MoltyDEX automatically swaps it. Zero config needed.

Perfect for agents that need to pay for APIs.
