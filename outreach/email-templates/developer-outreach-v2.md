**Subject:** MoltyDEX: Automatic Token Swapping for x402 Payments

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're working on [project/agent/x402 integration]. I built **MoltyDEX** - a DEX aggregator that solves a real problem for AI agents making x402 payments.

**The Problem:**
When an agent receives a 402 Payment Required response, it often doesn't have the exact token needed. The agent might have SOL, but the API wants USDC. Without automatic swapping, automation breaks.

**The Solution:**
MoltyDEX automatically swaps tokens when making x402 payments. Zero configuration needed.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Automatic token swapping (SOL → USDC, or any pair)
- ✅ Handles 402 Payment Required responses automatically
- ✅ Best prices across all Solana DEXes (Jupiter routing)
- ✅ Simple REST API or Python SDK
- ✅ Client-side signing (secure)
- ✅ Low fees (0.1%)

**Try it:** https://www.moltydex.com

I'd love to get your feedback and see if this could be useful for your project. Would you be open to a quick chat or demo?

Thanks!
[Your Name]
