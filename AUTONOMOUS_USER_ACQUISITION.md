## Notes

**Jupiter API:** Free tier is sufficient for current volume. No need to upgrade unless we see significant traffic.

**Product is Working:** After rollback, everything functions correctly. The "half working" concern was due to the React bug, which is now resolved.

**Focus Areas:**
1. Agent developers (x402 users)
2. Solana traders (best prices)
3. x402 protocol adopters

## Metrics to Track
- Website visitors (Google Analytics)
- API calls (Vercel logs)
- Swaps executed (on-chain)
- GitHub stars
- Community engagement
- Sign-ups (if added)

---

**Next Steps:** Continue autonomous execution of user acquisition activities.
