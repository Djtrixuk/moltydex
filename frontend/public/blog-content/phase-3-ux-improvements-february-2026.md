## Overview

We're excited to announce Phase 3 of our UX improvements! Building on the success of Phase 2, we've added five powerful new features that make token swapping faster, safer, and more intuitive.

---

## 🏷️ Token Categories & Tags

**What's New:** Tokens now display helpful category tags to make selection faster.

- **Stablecoin** (blue badge) - USDC, USDT
- **Popular** (purple badge) - Frequently traded tokens
- **Your Tokens** (green badge) - Tokens in your wallet

These tags appear throughout the token selector, making it easy to find what you're looking for at a glance.

## 📜 Swap History

**What's New:** Your last 20 swaps are now saved and easily accessible.

- View complete swap details (amounts, tokens, price impact)
- See timestamps for each swap
- Quick links to Solscan for transaction verification
- Clear history option

Access your swap history via the "📜 History" button in the swap interface header. Perfect for tracking your trading activity and verifying past transactions.

## ⏱️ Enhanced Transaction Status Display

**What's New:** Real-time progress tracking with visual indicators.

The transaction confirmation process now shows:
- **Transaction sent** (~2s) - ✅ Green when complete
- **Processing on network** (~10s) - 🟡 Yellow while processing
- **Finalizing confirmation** (~20s) - 🟢 Green when finalized

Plus an estimated time remaining counter so you know exactly how long to wait.

## 🛡️ Error Prevention

**What's New:** Proactive validation prevents common swap failures.

Before executing a swap, we now:
- ✅ Validate your balance is sufficient
- ✅ Check quote freshness (auto-refetches if stale)
- ✅ Provide clear error messages with actionable guidance

This means fewer failed transactions and a smoother swapping experience.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

**What's New:** Power users can navigate faster with keyboard shortcuts.

- **Ctrl/Cmd+K** - Focus the amount input field
- **Enter** - Execute swap (when enabled)
- **Tab** - Navigate between inputs (native browser behavior)

Speed up your workflow with these time-saving shortcuts!

- ⭐ Token favorites/bookmarks
