# DeployMolty: Live AI Trading for Solana Memes

## Overview

The paper trading phase is over. Today we are launching **DeployMolty** -- a live AI trading bot for Solana meme coins. Real money, real trades, powered by the MoltyDEX SDK.

Every swap DeployMolty executes routes through MoltyDEX and Jupiter for best prices across all Solana DEXes. Zero platform fees.

DeployMolty comes with its own token: **$DEPLOY**.

## From Paper to Real

On Wednesday we launched MoltCook for paper trading. Hundreds of traders tested strategies, climbed the leaderboard, and earned $COOK -- all without risking real money.

Now it is time to deploy.

DeployMolty takes the same AI that powered MoltCook and connects it to real on-chain trading. The difference: every trade is a real Solana transaction, every swap finds the best price via Jupiter aggregation, and every dollar of profit is yours to keep.

## How DeployMolty Works

1. **AI scans the market** -- Identifies meme coin opportunities based on volume, momentum, and on-chain signals
2. **You review or auto-execute** -- Choose to approve each trade manually or let the AI execute automatically
3. **MoltyDEX SDK routes the swap** -- Every trade goes through MoltyDEX, which uses Jupiter aggregation to find the best price across Raydium, Orca, and every other Solana DEX
4. **Zero platform fees** -- You pay only Solana network fees and Jupiter swap fees. MoltyDEX charges nothing on top.
5. **Track everything** -- Full trade history, P&L tracking, and on-chain verification via Solscan

## Why MoltyDEX SDK?

DeployMolty is not just a trading bot -- it is a live demonstration of what the MoltyDEX SDK can do for AI agents.

Every trade DeployMolty executes is a real transaction flowing through the MoltyDEX infrastructure:

- **Best price routing** via Jupiter aggregation across all Solana DEXes
- **Automatic token swapping** -- the bot can swap any token to any token
- **Zero platform fees** -- only network and DEX fees
- **Client-side signing** -- your private keys never leave your machine

This is what we mean when we say MoltyDEX is the infrastructure layer for AI agents on Solana. DeployMolty proves it works in production.

- **Trading rewards** -- 20% of supply reserved for active DeployMolty traders
