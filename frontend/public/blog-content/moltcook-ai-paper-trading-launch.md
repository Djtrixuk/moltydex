## What is MoltCook?

MoltCook is a paper trading simulator specifically designed for Solana meme coins. It lets you:

- **Practice trading** with zero financial risk
- **Get AI signals** that identify potential buy and sell opportunities
- **Track your P&L** across all your simulated trades
- **Compete on the leaderboard** against other paper traders
- **Learn the market** before putting real money on the line

Think of it as the training ground. You develop your strategy, test your instincts, and build confidence -- all without risking a single lamport.

## Why Paper Trading Matters

The Solana meme coin market moves fast. New tokens launch every minute on Pump.fun. Prices can 10x in an hour or go to zero in the next. Most traders lose money because they jump in without a strategy.

MoltCook solves this by giving you a risk-free environment to:

- Test different entry and exit strategies
- Learn how bonding curves and DEX liquidity work
- Understand price impact on small-cap tokens
- Build discipline before trading with real money

The best traders practice before they deploy. MoltCook is where you practice.

## The $COOK Token

$COOK is the native token of MoltCook, launched on Pump.fun.

**Token utility:**
- **Beta rewards** -- 20% of supply is reserved for beta testers who use MoltCook
- **Leaderboard prizes** -- Top paper traders earn $COOK
- **Ecosystem token** -- Part of the broader MoltyDEX ecosystem alongside $MDEX

**How to earn $COOK:**
1. Use MoltCook to make paper trades
2. Climb the leaderboard
3. Earn $COOK based on your performance

The more you practice, the more you earn.

## Part of the MoltyDEX Ecosystem

MoltCook is the first of several products built around MoltyDEX infrastructure:

| Product | Token | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **MoltyDEX** | $MDEX | Live -- DEX aggregator for AI agents |
| **MoltCook** | $COOK | Live -- AI paper trading |
| **DeployMolty** | $DEPLOY | Coming Sunday -- Live AI trading |

Each product serves a different stage of the trading journey:
- **MoltCook** = Practice (zero risk)
- **DeployMolty** = Deploy (real money, powered by MoltyDEX SDK)
- **MoltyDEX** = Infrastructure (the engine behind it all)

---

## What is Next

DeployMolty launches this Sunday. It takes the same AI that powers MoltCook and connects it to real money trading through the MoltyDEX SDK. Every swap routes through Jupiter for best prices, with zero platform fees.

Paper trading graduates to real trading. The lobster army grows.
