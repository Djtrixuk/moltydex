# MoltyDEX Revenue & Growth Plan
## Fast-Track to $1K+ Monthly Revenue

---

## 🎯 Current State
- ✅ Working product (swap + x402 auto-pay agent)
- ✅ SEO optimized website
- ✅ Marketing pages (developers, API providers)
- ✅ X account set up
- ❌ **Zero users** → **Zero revenue**

**Goal:** Get to $1,000+/month revenue within 30-60 days

---

## 💰 Revenue Model (Current)
- **0.1% fee** on every swap
- **Break-even:** ~$1,500/month volume = $1.50/day
- **Target:** $10k/day volume = $10/day = $300/month
- **Stretch:** $50k/day volume = $50/day = $1,500/month

**Key Insight:** Need volume, not high fees. Focus on adoption first.
