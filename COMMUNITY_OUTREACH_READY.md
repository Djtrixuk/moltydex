Hey x402 community! 👋

I built MoltyDEX - the first DEX aggregator specifically for x402 payments.

It automatically swaps tokens when agents receive 402 responses, making x402 adoption seamless for AI agents.

**Message:**
```
Hey! Built MoltyDEX - solves the token swapping problem for agents making x402 payments.

**The Problem:** Your agent gets a 402 Payment Required but has SOL when the API wants USDC. Automation breaks.

**The Solution:** MoltyDEX automatically:
1. Detects 402 responses
2. Checks your token balance
3. Swaps tokens if needed
4. Makes the payment
5. Retries the original request

Zero config needed. Simple API.

Perfect for agents that need to pay for APIs! 🤖

Hey r/solana! 👋

I built **MoltyDEX** - a DEX aggregator that's specifically designed for x402 payments and AI agents, but works great for regular traders too.

**What makes it different:**
- **0% platform fees** - Completely free (you only pay Solana network fees)
- **Best prices** - Routes through Jupiter to find optimal prices across all DEXes
- **AI Agent focused** - Automatically handles token swapping for x402 payments
- **Wallet token discovery** - Shows all tokens in your wallet (like Jupiter)
- **Clean UI** - Simple, fast interface

**For AI Agents:**
When your agent gets a 402 Payment Required but has the wrong token, MoltyDEX automatically swaps it. Zero configuration needed.

**For Traders:**
Just want the cheapest swaps? We've got you covered with 0% fees and best price routing.
